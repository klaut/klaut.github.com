<p>I had the pleasure of working with Tanja in the early stages of the development of StorkUp.  She is an extremely talented and capable developer and someone who I very much enjoyed working with.  She has an enviable mix of strong technical skills as well as an eye for design and the ability to communicate well with non-technical team members. In short she is able to see the project as a whole, as well as to focus in on specific areas and turn them from concept to reality.  She is modest and self-depreciating, which ensures that working with her is an enjoyable experience - with the focus is always on delivering the best possible results for the team. I've had the opportunity over the last 12+ years to work with a number of exceptional developers, and I would have no hesitation in including Tanja in my 'all star' team!</p>
