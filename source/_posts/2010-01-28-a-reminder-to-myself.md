title: A Reminder To Myself

<p>I like reading material on startups. It keeps me in a dreaming state where everything is possible and others successes are somehow mine as well.</p>
<p>So i am spending a lot of time on mixergy.com, and i watch one interview a day on average. Which is great - lot&rsquo;s of great insight and life stories in those interviews. The problem is that i keep spending my time in a passive state: watching, reading, thinking.</p>
<p>I read hacker news almost exclusively and i started to gather books on startups and entrepreneurs and i am set to &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In between my dreaming sessions i try to do some real work for my startup - mostly the fun ones: finding a right name and domain,still deciding what features the app should have, planning how my customer service is not going to suck once my app is big, how my arrogance is not going to grow and how am i going to enjoy my financial freedom once i make it.</p>
<p>What i really need is motivation and a kick in the butt. I get set back quite easily and is all done by myself alone. But i also get motivated easily, it just doesn&rsquo;t last long. How to change that? This is not getting me anywhere and to be honest, i haven&rsquo;t really started producing anything yet.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon! it is time to start kicking!</p>
