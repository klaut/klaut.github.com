title: How to Gain More Time (part 1)

<p>You gain time by being efficient. The problem is, I am anything but efficient. I need to change.</p>
<p>I love weekends. Who doesn&rsquo;t? The opportunity to sleep in late, have breakfast in bed, walking all day around in pajamas. Hey, the only &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; you do is you brush your teeth, wash your face and put some moisturizer on. The luxury of living alone ;). But the weekends end so quickly. Before you know it mr. Monday is here and wants you out of bed before 8 am. Bummer.</p>
<p>The problem is, I never seem to have enough time. Time to spend on my startup. It is difficult during the week because of my 9-5 job but it is no different during weekends because i sleep until 12. What a waste of time!</p>
<p>I figured out that if i go to the gym and do some workout immediately after work (and just one hour is enough to recharge), I come home less mentally tired and can work again. This time on MY project. But the weekends are still inefficient. The later I wake up, the less i do.</p>
<p>I set a new rule. Every day I wake up at 7 am. No later. And no matter if it is Monday, Sunday, Saturday or Wednesday. Every day at 7 am i am OUT OF BED. And you know what? It is not so difficult to wake up early on the weekends, after all. I actually like it. I do more in those hours until 12 pm than during all the time put together afterwards.</p>
<p>My aim is to start to wake up at 5 am. But just the thought of it scares me. Yes, I know, it is the <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html">lizard brain</a> that is complaining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next on the how-to-gain-time list is to reduce distractions and procrastination.</p>
