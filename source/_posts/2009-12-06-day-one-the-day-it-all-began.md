<p>The idea of starting something of my own, my own web based startup, and growing along the way has been burning inside me for some time now. I think it's been something like two years that i am thinking about it but not much has actually been done yet. Up until today. Well, not that today i am going to do something extraordinary. It is just that today i decided to log the progress i am making (hopefully on a weekly, if not daily, basis) to carry this hidden desire of mine from a simple fantasy to actual execution.</p>
<p>I have no experience in business, i have no experience in marketing, i have no experience in raising money, I have no experience ... well, all i know is how to program and i am fairly good at design. But i plan to learn everything it takes to at least try and make my idea real. After, if it fails, at least i will learn something from it and my next idea is going to have more chances to succeed. Because, in all honesty, i am a little bit tired to work for others.</p>
<p>I promised myself that i will not let myself panic and back out when things will get though (and i suspect they will get tough). Because heroes never panic. I think it is about time i start to become one :)</p>
