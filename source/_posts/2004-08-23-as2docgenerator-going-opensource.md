I recieved quite a few emails regarding as2docgenerator updates, aditional features, offering help, asking for source code ... and i would like to thank each one of you for showing interest in this little project :)

I realized that if as2docgenerator is going to improve i would need help from other developers, so i decided to submit it to <a href="https://developer.berlios.de/">berliOS Developer</a> website (thank you Aral for the tip :)) under the GNU GLP.
If you want to help you need to register at berliOS and then mail me your username so i can add you to the project.
