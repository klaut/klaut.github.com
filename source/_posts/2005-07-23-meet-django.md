I think i've found my perfect python web framework! <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Meet Django.</a>

What you get?
(quoted from the official site)

Object-relational mapper - define your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free

URLDispatcher - design pretty URLs with no framework-specific limitations. Be as flexible as you like.

Template system - Use Django's powerful and extensible template language to separate design, content and Python code.

Cache system - Hook into memcached or other cache frameworks for super caching -- as granularly as you need.

Automatic admin interface -Save yourself the tedious work of creating interfaces for people to add and update content. Django does that automatically.


Give it a try, read the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/overview/">overview</a> and go through <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/tutorial1/">the tutorial</a>. I was impressed :)
