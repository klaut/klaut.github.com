There are some python utilities that use Movable Type's XML-RPC interface and thus allow you to view, post, delete and edit weblog entries, and more...

.. and of course, i just got a really cool idea (to me at least ;))
what if i make a flash interface for such a tool? We know how to embed flash into python, don't we? :)
right, .. all i need is some free time ....
