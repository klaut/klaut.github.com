Joey Lott, the author of Actionscript Cookbook, has posted a set of UI Flash Components at his site:
- Button
- Loader
- ProgressBar
- ScrollBar
- ScrollPane
- Window
- TextArea

The reason, he writes, for making them is because the current MM components are rather heavy.. and some of them do not work properly.
Lott's components are still in the alpha stage, but if you want to try them you can download them here:
