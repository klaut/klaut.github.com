<p>It is November. This means long nights, rain and wind (at least in Scotland). But it also means that the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_141079939271952" title="HN November Launch Pad" target="_self">HN November Launch Pad</a> has started.</p>
<p>I decided to join in with a little idea that popped into my head couple of weeks ago - just around the time when i resigned from my current job.</p>
<p>The problem: I need to be as frugal as possible and have a simple tool to track my expenses.</p>
<p>The solution: <a href="http://tagpenny.posterous.com" title="Tag Penny" target="_self">Tag Penny</a>.</p>
<p>The name is not finalized yet. Well, to be honest, it is still all mostly at the idea stage. But i got two domains that I just bought and now I have this dilema: which name is better? Expenseplan.com? Tagpenny.com? None? Anyway, I will just continue with the development and maybe the perfect name will crystalize as I go along.</p>
