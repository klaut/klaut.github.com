So this is it.

My last stuff has been packed, the apartment has been cleaned and all that is left is to hand out the keys to the owner and wait for Sunday to arrive.
I am going to Denmark and will stay there for the next 5 months and although I have been planning it for a year now, it sure feels like it has arrived too soon. But it also brings that excitement and anticipation of the unknown that somehow spices up my otherwise pretty ordinary days. I haven't felt like this in a long time, to be honest. Which says a lot of what kind of life I've lead since I decided that maybe this whole computer business is something I might like :) ... you know ... sex 'n' drugs 'n' bytecode.
