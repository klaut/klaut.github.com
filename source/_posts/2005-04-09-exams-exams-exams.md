That time of year is slowly approaching.. What time of year, you may ask? Well, since last October, i am back to university (this time i am really finishing my BCS degree, honest) and the exams are round the corner :) I am actually enjoying studying more than i did years ago.. and (this sounds kinda scary, i know) i am kind of looking forward to the exams :))

Anyway, the point of the post was something else: finally, after more than a year of thinking about it, i actually took the time to go and pass the Sun Java Programmer Certification exam... yes, i passed! w00t! (scored 83%)
So, here's another certification to add to the collection: Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform 1.4.
Next, please...
;)
