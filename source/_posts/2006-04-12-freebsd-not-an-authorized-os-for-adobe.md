On <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-questions/2006-April/118790.html">freebsd-questions mailing list</a> someone asked why was linux-flashplugin removed from the ports.
Well, the answer was that it was removed because according to Macrom .. oops .. Adobe End User License Agreement it is explicitly forbidden to run the Flash Player on FreeBSD (or on any unauthorized operating system).
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/license/desktop/">See License Agreement, section 3.a.D</a>.

The question now is, must i remove it from my system or not as i have installed it before the license was changed? (when and why was it changed, by the way?)
