Thank you Macromedia for the very nice gift! :)
The Timbuk2 Laptop Messenger bag is great and my laptop fits perfectly :) ... and it came just on time, as if MM knew that i have school starting in a week and was looking for a nice bag to carry my laptop around :D
Thank you also for the nice "Go to And Play" tshirt, the UI flash cards and the personaly signed letter from Mike Chambers.

The Fedex box arrived on Wednesday (unfortunatelly i had to pay 60 euros of taxes), but i wasn't able to open it and see what's inside till this Friday (i was away).

I would also like to thank Christian Cantrell for sending me the letter about Central 1.5 release.

I am not sure what i did to turn up on Macromedia "gift list" (this is not the first time i recieve a gift from MM) but i feel happy and honoured and glad :)
Thank you again!
