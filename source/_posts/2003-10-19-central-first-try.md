Today i've been playing with <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/central/sdk/">macromedia central sdk</a>. There is quite some new stuff to learn but it's quite easy to make some simple "begginer" applications :)
well.. here's mine:
<a href="http://www.klaustrofobik.org/centralApps/fullAsAGoogReader/installer.html">GoogService</a>

Its a <a href="http://www.fullasagoog.com/">fullasagoog</a> blog readed and it uses flash remoting to connect to <a href="http://www.fullasagoog.com/webservice.cfm">goog's webservice.</a>
It's still in its early stage and it's not really good looking, but it gets the job done for now :)
anyway.. now i have to learn how to save downloaded blogs for off line reading!

Many thanks to <a href="http://www.centralmx.com/">centralmx</a>  for posting it at their site! :)
