<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>For attractive lips, speak words of kindness.<br />For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people. <br />For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. <br />For beautiful hair, let a child run his/her fingers through it once a day. <br />For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone.Â </p>
<p>People, even more than things, have to be restored, renewed, revived, reclaimed, and redeemed; never throw out anyone. Remember, if you ever need a helping hand, you will find one at the end of each of your arms. As you grow older, you will discover that you have two hands; one for helping yourself, and the other for helping others.</p>
