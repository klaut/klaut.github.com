title: Weekends Are For Cooking

<p>I moved to Scotland in September 2009. I am slowly settling down (meaning my apartment is getting filled up with stuff that will just get in the way when i am moving again) but i miss good food. Let&rsquo;s face it - Scotts do not eat well. I don&rsquo;t like haggis or fish &lsquo;n&rsquo; chips. And i cannot eat steak every day. I was using microwave and buying ready made food from Tesco at the beginning (to save time mainly) but this is not a healthy diet and you see the results on your body pretty quick. Gym alone won&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>I love italian food. I can make some (<a href="http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Impepata-di-cozze.html">impepata di cozze</a> is my speciality) but my skills are limited. Very.</p>
<p>After watching the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135503/">Julie And Julia</a> I got hooked up about cooking. And i realized that I could &ldquo;kill two birds with one stone&rdquo;. I could buy a recipe book about italian food and start cooking at home from scratch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so I did. I fired up Amazon and ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Made-Italy-Stories-Giorgio-Locatelli/dp/1841157023/">Made In Italy</a>. The book just arrived today and after a fast first glance I think I made a very nice purchase. The book looks fabulous! Now my aim is to cook something from it every weekend. I just need to find some quality grocery stores around here to buy the ingredients from. I am afraid that Tesco alone won&rsquo;t cut it.</p>
