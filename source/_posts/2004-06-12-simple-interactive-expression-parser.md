It's been a long time since my last post and to put some "life" back to this blog, i thought i'd post one of those "ported from java" experiments.
Very little work on my part, actually.. thanks to syntax similarities between AS2 and java.

This one is from the book <a href="http://www.jamesholmes.com/TheArtOfJava/">The Art of Java</a>, Chapter 2: A Recursive-Descent Expression Parser.
