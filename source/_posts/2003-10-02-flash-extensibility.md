FlashMX2004 has been out for almost a month now and still no official documentation from macromedia about jsfl :(
Thank god there are places online where one can find all the information and start experimenting with this new addition.
<a href="http://www.flashextensibility.com/forums/index.php">flashextensibility.com</a> - forums run by authors of the soon-to-be released book <a href="http://www.flashextensibility.com/">"Extending Flash MX 2004: A Guide And Complete Reference"</a> (i must say that i'm really excited about this book and can't wait for it to come out!)
<a href="http://www.dynamicflash.co.uk/jsfl/">Flash MX 2004 JSFL Reference</a> - a pretty detailed reference of jsfl (and till now the ONLY reference you can get)
<a href="http://www.actionscript.nl/JSAPI/xml2.htm">XML to UI Unauthorized version</a> - tutorials that will get you started using jsfl and xml to extend your Commands menu in Flash
<a href="http://flashguru.co.uk/mailman/listinfo/extendflash_flashguru.co.uk">ExtendFlash mailing linst</a> - a list run by <a href="http://www.flashguru.co.uk/">flashguru.co.uk</a>

so, armed with all this documentation i made my first custom command .. ok, i admit, it is really small and humble but it's something that i am actually using quite often now :)

No matter how hard i try i always forget color hex numbers.. and i really hate it when writing actionscript code, to have to close the ASpanel and open the color window, find my color, copy the hex and go back to ASpanel to paste it. Maybe there were other, more efficient ways for doing it that i'm unaware of ? .. anyway, when i first read about jsfl i thought: "hey, making a custom command that would paste the chosen hex color number into your AS window doesn't seem to be such a daunting task! even i can try and make it!"

and guess what? it wasn't hard! :) .. in a couple of minutes i was inserting the "hexes" into my ASpanel like a mad monkey ;)

if you want to try it, download the zip and unpack it in your
C:\Documents and Settings\[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash MX 2004\en\Configuration\Commands folder.
