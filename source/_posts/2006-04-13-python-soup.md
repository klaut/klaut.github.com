If you are Slovene happening to read this blog and programming/using/loving/liking/dreaming Python you should know that there is a new <a href="http://soup.zen.si/">Slovene Python user group around - SOUP (Slovene Orthodox Users of Python)</a>.
Actually i don't think there was an "old" python user group in the first place, so that makes it the first Python user group :)
