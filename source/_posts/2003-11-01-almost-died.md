Yesterday (31st october) was a strange day.
I could not boot my machine and it looked like one of my hds just died! This would mean all my important stuff (work files, mails and other things) would be gone for good.... of course, my last backup was from.. ehm... last year? :(
Anyway, i was scared like shit.. and frustrated.. and pissed off.. and... and...
There was no point in staring at the "failed to boot. please insert the system disk and press enter" message all day, so i switched the machine off and went doing other things (like hanging around with my dog and cats and other social stuff - seeing people!) ....

I woke up this morning, determined to fix the problem ( taking the corruped HD out and making a new, clean install of the OS - i already said goodbye to my files)  .... i just wanted to try to boot it for the last time, although i already knew it would be in vain ...... GUESS WHAT??? it booted alright! everything is like.. ok! i mean.. what happened yesterday? did one of the hard drives decide to dress up like a ghost and play invisible for the halloween?

oh, well... im doing my backups today :)
