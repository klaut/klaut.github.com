This is something i didn't know it exsisted until just recently: <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flash/mx2004/index.html">Flash MX2004 Livedocs at MM site</a>.
All the documentation from the Help panel is now online, but you can also add your own comments or code samples and read others. It is something that's got potential if flash users (we) will start "using" it :)
