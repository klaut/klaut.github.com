For some time now i've been thinking of changing my blog engine (currently it is Movable Type) to something else.
Why? .. well, i don't like the way you edit templates in MT and the comment-spammers are really annoying and i don't think <a href="http://www.web-rat.com">Todd</a> will ever upgrade the current MT version (and, don't worry Todd, i don't even want to ;))
So, while waiting for Todd to finish up his CF blogging system (and then pass it on to me ;)) I have narrowed down my choice to two options: <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> and <a href="http://wiki.subtlehints.net/moin/PyBlosxom">PyBlosxom</a>.

I like Textpattern for its ease of use and configuration and being very flexible. On the other hand, PyBlosxom is written in Python and as such very appealing (oportunity to learn more Python! :D)
Does any of you know of other (possibly Python) blog systems worth taking a look?
