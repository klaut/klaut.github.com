title: Really, Don't Panic

<p>Yet again I managed to neglect my duties towards Heroes Never Panic. I always seem to fall into same patterns of procrastination. I am hopeless :)</p>
<p>I finally let go of a relationship that, even though the person meant everything for me for the last 4 years, it was not meant to be and I am starting to feel happier and lighter again. The hardest part is to prevent yourself from thinking about it. And force yourself to get busy.</p>
<p>While I was fighting against myself, some projects have piled up on my desk so I need to sort myself out and start working on them seriously.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">The Booking Bee</span></strong></p>
<p>Oh, my dear little bee. I was so excited when i started working on this project and look at it now! It has been months since I touched it!&nbsp;Yesterday I rolled up the sleeves and started fixing bugs and polishing code. And before you know it, it was 11pm!! Where did Sunday go?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still a lot of features (critical ones) missing before I can open up the beta for the public, but I was surprised to see that it was not THAT bad after all. And I am all hooked up again!</p>

<p>Well, as you could observe, I wasn't able to finish it last November. But i did finish the mockups, bought the domain and set up a blog (that nobody updates). If i really get myself to start working on it, I think it has potential. Maybe even more than Booking Bee.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">E-Book</span></strong></p>
<p>Got this idea that maybe I fancy to try writing. It was always a thing at the back of my head but never really thought I'd do it. Well, up until now. I know few people that are starting a business (or have a business) and feel lost when they need to hire or deal with a developer. I guess I could do worse than writing a little ebook guide about it. What you need to know, how to manage the project, how to communicate with developers, traps that you can fall into... I set up a survey over at Wufoo.com and got some replies back (not many, but enough that I could see the common pattern). Trying to figure out a structure of the guide now :)</p>
<p>Hey, it is still up and I am always glad to get more input:&nbsp;<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;"><a href="http://bit.ly/ffBJuN" target="_blank" style="color: #196b7b;">http://bit.ly/ffBJuN</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: medium;">Mongolia</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">Don't ask me why or how, but this summer I go to Mongolia. Somehow friends persuaded me to just dive in and join them on this adventure. I know it is something I desperately need, something completely different and unknown.<br />It's going to be just for 12 days but I know I'll come back revitalised. I already have an idea for a web app! See, we are now group mailing among us about all the stuff that needs to be done and organized before the trip. I looked online and yes, there are few group trip management apps out there, but none of them is particularly suited to what we need. So i thought that it could be a nice opportunity to build something quick. And as I was trying to find something to build to learn node.js, this could be the right thing to do.</span></p>
