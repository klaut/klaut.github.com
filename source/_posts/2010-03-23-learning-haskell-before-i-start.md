Each Monday from now on, I am going to publish a small step that I made during the week into mastering <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskel</a>l. This is a commitment that I make to myself and by deciding to make the progress public (although you may be the one and only reader) I am kind of forcing myself to stick to it.

Why Haskell? Why now?

Well, first, let me tell you that learning a new programming language is actually very exciting. It is Â like when you were a kid and you were given a new toy. Remember how excited you were? You just could not wait to unwrap it and start playing.

Having said that, Haskell has been on my radar for some time. I just never really took the time to start looking deeper into it. And I realized that if I am going to wait until I think I have more time, it is never going to happen. You have only so much time as you give it to yourself. So this excuse is not going to cut it anymore.

Oh, and why Haskell I hear you wonder? Because I want to add a functional programming language to my arsenal. Because it is gaining in popularity but it is still underground enough to feel exotic. Because it is lazy. Because I've been pretty intrigued about what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">monad</a> is.
