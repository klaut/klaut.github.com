With great pleasure I discovered this morning  that <a title="the definite guide" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/059600401X?v=glance"> Flash Remoting: the Definite Guide</a> has been added to <a title="O'Reilly Network Safari Bookshelf" href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Network Safari Bookshelf</a>.
Uhmm.. I'm not sure how much work will get done in the next couple of days (or how much sleep will i get?).
