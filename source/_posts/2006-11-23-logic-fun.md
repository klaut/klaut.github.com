Ok, here's one for you :)

You have two badly-woven ropes with fluctuating widths, but which you know take one hour each to burn completely. But because of their fluctuating widths, thicker parts take longer to burn, so half of each rope may take longer or shorter than 30 minutes to burn. Using these two ropes, how can you time 45 minutes?
