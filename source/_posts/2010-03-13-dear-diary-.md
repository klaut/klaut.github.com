<p>Reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Are-Indispensable-Seth-Godin/dp/1591843162">Linchpin</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591842808/">Start With Why</a> at the moment (yes, I always read more than one book in parallel). They make me asking myself why am I not producing more of what I believe in. The truth is, I am not sure how to do it. And I am afraid to fail. I need to fight with this fear everyday, telling myself that it is GOOD to fail. Because when you fail, you are one failure closer to your goal.</p>
<p>Things are certainly moving in the right direction. It is going slower than I would like, though. Maybe doing it all alone is not such a good decision. I feel (well, actually I know) I need somebody to bounce ideas off. Yes, I can do it with friends, but that is not exactly the same thing. To have somebody that is directly involved in this would help.</p>
<p>I would definitely feel more confident in jumping into it full time if there was another person next to me doing the same. I am afraid that if I jump into it alone I might fail quite soon. That I would be like a headless chicken doing things all wrong. So it stays as an evening project for now.</p>
<p>Another downside of doing it solo is that I make all decisions myself and then, due to outside distractions, I don&rsquo;t stay true to them. It is so easy to come up with reasons why I did not deliver what I said I would.</p>
