Version control systems are important. No argue about that. At places where i used to work (and am currently working) i had the pleasure to meet three systems: cvs, perforce and subversion. All three have one important thing in common - they all suck. Well, some suck less than others (like subversion).

For my pet projects i decided to try these new kids on the block (read distributed version controls). I narrowed down to two: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">mercurial</a>. I went for mercurial. Why? Well, first because it is written in Python and i have a thing for Python. I just love it. Second because <a href="http://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a> looks just nicer and cooler than <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>. And third ... well, I think <a href="http://hginit.com/">this guide by Joel Spolsky</a> explains it much much better than i could do. Enjoy and be persuaded ;)
