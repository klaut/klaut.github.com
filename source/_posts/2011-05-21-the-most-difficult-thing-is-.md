<p>Why is inertia so difficult to overcome?</p>
<p>Everything would be so much easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>all these app ideas that are popping into my head? Done.&nbsp;</li>
<li>the ebook i am trying to write? Phew, piece of cake - done.</li>
<li>broken heart? No worries, recovered in a lightning speed.</li>
<li>all the illustrations that started back to from in my head? Done.</li>
<li>the messy flat? Ha, all shiny now!</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead? Nada. Zip. I've done nothing.<br /> Oh, i have to-do lists long to the moon and back, but actual stuff done? Err .. ok, I've started some ... but not finished anything yet. And the most difficult part? The paradox? The&nbsp;insurmountable mountain? One fights inertia with "just start doing it". Yeah. To actually go somewhere, you have to start walking.</p>
