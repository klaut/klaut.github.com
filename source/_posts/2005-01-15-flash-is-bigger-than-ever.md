It's been ages since my last post but these things are big enough that woke me up and made me blog about them:

1) You can compile actionscript 2 files into swf without the Flash IDE.
I just installed <a href="http://team.motion-twin.com/ncannasse/mtasc.html">MTASC (Motion-Twin Actionscript2 Compiler)</a> on my linux box and compiled my first swf movie, how cool is that?!
The compiler is opensource and free, it is a command line compiler so you can integrate it with your fav editor, it is actually quite simple to install (for win there is no installation whatsoever, for linux you just need to make sure that you have OCaml installed) and according to the official page, it is faster than the MM compiler.
The least you can do is try it out ;)

2) There is a new kind of generic documentation generator in the hood: <a href="http://naturaldocs.org/about.html">Naturaldocs</a>
Aral from <a href="http://www.flashant.org">Flashant</a> has started a campaign to bring support for <a href="http://www.darronschall.com/weblog/archives/000142.cfm">Actionscrip 2 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</a> into Naturaldocs. <a href="http://www.flashant.org/index.php?p=262&amp;more=1&amp;c=1">Read more deatils here.</a>

3) Actually, this has been news for some time now, but i find it extremelly important for rich application development (and i haven't blogged about it when it was fresh news) so i am goin to point it out here too:
The great guys and gals from Ariaware have released  <a href="http://www.ariaware.com/products/arp/">ARP, an open-source pattern-based framewrok for Flash and Flex  RIA development.</a>

Is Flash bigger than ever or what? ;)
