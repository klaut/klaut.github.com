Today is the <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day</a> - a day to celebrate women in technology and science.

Although I am not much into dividing people into groups based on gender, race, religion, etc, it is a very noticeable fact that there simply are too few women in technology. I noticed it since I first developed an interest for computers, I continued to notice it during the university (hey, in the first year there were maybe 10 girls out of 100 students!) and it is a regular fact in every job that I had. Usually, I was one of the few female programmers, sometimes the only one.

I would like to bring attention to one of my heroes from the BSD community: <a href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/bsd-guru/">Dru Lavigne</a>.

Dru is an authority in the BSD world. She is a network and systems administrator, IT instructor and technical writer. She has written several books on BSD, the most famous one, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/BSD-Hacks-100-Industrial-Tools/dp/0596006799">BSD Hacks</a> I happen to own, and has been my reference for most things BSD. Iâ€™ve read it cover to cover several times during my early years when I was learning FreeBSD.

Dru writes regulary on her technical blog<a href="http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/bsd-guru/"> A Year in the Life of a BSD Guru</a>
