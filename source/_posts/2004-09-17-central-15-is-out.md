I am sure everybody is blogging about this already, so i am going to be short:
Macromedia Central 1.5 is finally out.
New features in this release (btw, this is still a developer release) are:
- File I/O support
- File upload and download support
- Automatic network detection
- Flash MX 2004 extensions to better integrate Flash authoring with Central during development
- Support for Flash Player 7, ActionScript 2.0, and the new component architecture
- Support for instant messaging and presence detection using the AOL AIM and ICQ networks
Also, Macromedia distilled Central licensing down into two simple models:
- open distribution
- try buy
